## Overview
In our research, titled "Gender Distribution, Compensation, and Tool Usage in Data Careers: A Multi-Year Study", we delve deep into the world of data-driven careers to identify key patterns and trends. Spanning across multiple years, we explore how gender distribution has evolved over time in these fields, unveiling whether they are progressing towards more inclusivity. 
Additionally, we analyse the prominence of different data science tools in varying job roles to understand their significance in this landscape. 
Simultaneously, we investigate the compensation structures prevalent in these roles and how they correlate with various demographic factors. Our multi-faceted approach provides a comprehensive picture of the current scenario in data-focused careers, and reveals vital insights that can shape the understanding of prospective professionals in this domain.

## Project Documentation

### Repository Contents

- `data`: This directory contains all the datasets used for this analysis, including the raw Kaggle Annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey data for each year from 2020 to 2022, and our cleaned dataset merged_data.
- `code`: Our complete code for the project is in the .ipynb file, you can navigate through our code from there. It has each of the following steps: data cleaning, preprocessing, visulsation.
- `report`: Our report is the .doc file, you could read about the background of our study, our key findings and more in-depth analysis from there.

### Tools Used
We used Python for our data analysis, along with several prominent libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`, `plotly`, and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing.
- `statsmodels`: For the ordinal logistic regression model.
- `pycountry`: a library that maps country names to the country code for retrieving data from the inflation API.

We developed our scripts using Jupyter Notebook, which provides a robust and flexible environment for data analysis.

### Continued development
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the data science field, looking at trends in gender distribution, compensation structure, and tool usage over a period of three years. However, the potential for further development and expansion is vast.

Here are a couple of ways future contributors could extend and enhance this work:

1. **Tool Grouping and Regression Analysis**: One of the key aspects we've studied is the usage of various tools in different data science roles. A potential area of improvement could be to group these tools based on their usage or functionality and analyze their impact on the compensation structure using ordinal logistic regression models. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of how tool expertise impacts compensation.

2. **Incorporating Historical Data**: While this analysis focuses on the years 2020 to 2022, there are several more years of Kaggle survey data available. Future contributors could extend the timeframe of the analysis to examine longer-term trends and verify if the observations hold over a larger span of years. This could offer valuable insights into the evolution of the data science field.
